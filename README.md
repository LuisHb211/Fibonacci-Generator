# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This code generates an array where each element is based on the Fibonacci sequence. The size of the array is determined by user input. Additionally, a new text file in the .txt format is created, containing each element's value from the array, with each value on a separate line.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to input the desired size of the Fibonacci sequence array.

2. The code generates the Fibonacci sequence based on the user's input and stores it in an array.

3. A new text file with a .txt extension is created.

4. Each element of the Fibonacci sequence array is written to the text file, with each element's value on a separate line.

## Usage

To use this code:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Run the code and follow the prompts to input the desired size of the Fibonacci sequence.

3. After the code execution, you will find a text file in the same directory with the generated Fibonacci sequence values.

## Example

Suppose you input a size of 5 for the Fibonacci sequence. The generated text file (fibonacci_sequence.txt) would contain:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3.
